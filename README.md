# DualLock Vault System
These scripts were created to control interior double doors inside of a bank vault in Second Life for roleplay purposes. 

These scripts are very specific to a custom mesh insert created by Lexbot Sinister for use with a building called "The Bank" by Minimal, which is available for purchase on the Second Life Marketplace here: https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/MINIMAL-The-Bank/26708842

I decided to make this repo public as a learning aid for others interested in learning to write code using Linden Scripting Language for Second Life.

The custom insert mesh object is an interior secured area placed inside of the vault, that are sealed with double doors which are configured as a tandem locking system, requiring two avatars to unlock the doors simultaneously using their individual key cards and PINs.
